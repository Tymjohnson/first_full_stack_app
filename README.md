First fullstack app
This is my first attempt at a fullstack application built following a guide from Jelo Rivera at https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/full-stack-mongodb-react-node-js-express-js-in-one-simple-app-6cc8ed6de274
This application connects a ReactJS frontend to a MongoDB and Node.JS backend. It's primary
purpose is a basic database. It lets you add and delete items by a key, starting at 0 with the first item input.

#TODO Storing multiple items without refreshing the page stores multiple items under the same # ID. Deleting the same # ID starts at the 
oldest occurence of the ID.
